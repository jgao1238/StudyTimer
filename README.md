# StudyTimer
The Pomodoro Method breaks down work periods into intervals known as Pomodoro, which is Italian for tomato. The method helps a user maximize their ability to focus due to the mandatory break interval that follows each work period. The most common time length is 25 minutes followed by 5 minutes of break, but this timer also features a 45 and 90 minute work interval.
